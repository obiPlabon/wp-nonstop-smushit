Disable bulk smush limit and enjoy a premium feature of ***WP Smushit*** completely FREE üòâ

== Description ==
[WP Smushit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/ "Smush Image Compression and Optimization") is a great WordPress plugin üòá to compress and optimize images for better performance. Unsurprisingly it's not completely free and it should not be because of its awesome features. But I just wanted the bulk compression feature for FREE. So, I created this add-on plugin and it does the job so well that I don't need to think about clicking the smush button again.

Note: ***WP Nonstop Smushit*** doesn't have any user interface or UI.
