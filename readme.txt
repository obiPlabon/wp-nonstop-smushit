Dodge WP Smushit bulk smush limit by clicking on the bulk smush button automatically whenever WP Smushit reaches the limit.

== Description ==
WP Smushit is a superb plugin to compress images but there's a bulk smush limit (50 images) for Free users. So I've created WP Nonstop Smushit to rescue us :D Now enjoy the limitless smushing!
