Disable the bulk smush limit and unlock the premium bulk optimization feature of **Smush Image Optimization** — completely FREE! 🚀

== Description ==

[Smush Image Optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/ "Smush Image Optimization") is an amazing WordPress plugin 😇 that compresses and optimizes your images for better site performance. 

However, the free version comes with a limitation — you can only bulk smush 50 images at a time.  
This plugin removes that restriction so you can optimize all your images at once, automatically, without repeatedly clicking the **“Resume”** button.

It’s a simple, lightweight add-on with **no user interface** — just activate and forget.  
Enjoy seamless, unlimited image optimization with zero extra setup!
