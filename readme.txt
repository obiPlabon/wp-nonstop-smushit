Disable bulk smash limit and enjoy a premium feature of WP Smashit completely FREE!

== Description ==
[WP Smushit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/ "Smush Image Compression and Optimization") is a great WordPress plugin to compress and optimize images for better performance. Unsurprisingly it's not completely free and it should not be because of its awesome features. But I just wanted the bulk compression feature for FREE. So, I created this add-on plugin and it does the job so well that I don't need to think about clicking the smush button again.

Technically this plugin doesn't disable the bulk limit, what it does is whenever WP Smushit reaches the bulk smush limit (50 images) this plugin clicks the smush button automatically and the compression process goes on smoothly.
Note: ***WP Nonstop Smushit*** doesn't have any user interface or UI.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will there be any problem from WP Smushit? ==
